Barrick Innovate Hack project

## The Problems
  * Large number of unexploited lands due to the overhead involved in any operations.
  * Considerable number of AMS engaging in illegal mining due to a lack of governing entity.
  * Unstable employment related to price fluctuation

## Our Solution
Based on samples, Barrick determines the scale of hypothetical operation. Depending on the density of the mine Barrick either buys the land or supports AMS activity on this land. AMS would go through a training process to ensure health and safety, as well as other standards, are met. Upon completion, said AMS enters our database of trusted party and funding is automatically sent to the party involved and a new relationship between Barrick and the AMS starts. All data, from sample to partnership, is added to the blockchain for reference.

### Hypothesis
Supporting employment rate in local areas will lead to reduced conflicts, decrease in illegal mining activities and improved health and safety.
